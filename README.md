# Casa Ereaux Wines
## This is the 2021 web page version of Casa Ereaux Wines.

### Challenge:
1. Fully Responsive Website
2. Clear Communication of the Concept
3. Presentation of the Products & Branding


### Tools: 
1. Adobe XD
2. Adobe Illustrator
3. Adobe Photoshop
4. Visual Studio Code
5. Front End Dev: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, GSAP Animation Library.


### My Role:

In this project, my role had a 360º view/action responsibility, from branding to product development. I intervened as a UI designer, front end developer and branding master.

My collaboration with Casa Ereaux began with brand development. Once I got deep into the project, I gladly took on pretty much every task. I didn’t limit myself to branding, but developed the website.


### THE PROBLEM

Casa Ereaux had poor existence over digital media so it needed to be freshened up to date.

Also they didn’t have a strong and concrete visual identity and could not communicate clearly.

### THE SOLUTION

Creating a concept that could describe the wine and connect with the audience and communicate it through user touchpoints, in this case, the creation of a website.
